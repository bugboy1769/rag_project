The University Karate Club is a historic martial arts institution currently facing a deep internal schism. 

At the heart of the conflict are two central figures: Mr Hi and John A. 
Mr Hi is the primary instructor of the karate club. He is a technical master who teaches traditional martial arts and emphasizes discipline and honor. 
John A is the administrator of the karate club. He manages the club's finances, handles logistics, and controls the administrative overhead of the organization.

The club has fractured into two distinct factions. 
The Instructor's Faction is led by Mr Hi. This group consists of students who are deeply loyal to the teachings of the martial arts. 
Member 1 is a dedicated student and close friend of Mr Hi. Member 1 trains under Mr Hi daily and serves as an informal mentor to newer students.
Member 2 is friends with Mr Hi and often trains alongside Member 1. Member 2 is known for a strong commitment to the instructor's philosophy.
Member 4 is also friends with Mr Hi. Member 4 is a regular practitioner who avoids the administrative politics to focus on training.

In opposition, the Administrator's Faction is led by John A. This group prioritizes the organizational and financial stability of the club.
Member 32 is a close ally and friend of John A. Member 32 supports the administrator's vision for club reform.
Member 31 is friends with John A and manages the club's membership logistics.
Member 30 is friends with John A and is considered a loyalist to the administrative bureaucracy.

Positioned between these two warring sides is Member 3. 
Member 3 is friends with both Mr Hi and John A. Because of these dual ties, Member 3 acts as a bridge, maintaining communication between the instructor and the administrator even as the factions move further apart.

The tension reached a breaking point during a club meeting where Mr Hi led one faction in a protest, while John A led the other faction in a counter-proposal. 
As a result of this fission, members who trained primarily with Mr Hi stayed with his new school, while members close to John A left to form a separate administrative body.
Those who remained under Mr Hi's guidance include Member 1, Member 2, and Member 4, while those who departed with John A include Member 30, Member 31, and Member 32.
